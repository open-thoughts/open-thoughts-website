There is a github workflow that automatically deploys new changes to production. 
However, since we are using the free (hobby) plan, multiple team members can't be added to the Vercel project. 
Since deployment requires authorized team members, please make the changes you are happy with and view on localhost. Then ping @ryanmarten to merge those into main or push a following commit that will make the workflow run.
