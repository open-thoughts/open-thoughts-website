A community effort to curate the best open post-training datasets.

We are currently working on [OpenThoughts-Agent](/blog/agent), a collaboration building the best open agent training datasets.

Our first project was curating open reasoning data recipes. [OpenThoughts3](/blog/ot3), our best reasoning dataset recipe, is detailed in our [release blog](/blog/ot3) and the [full paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04178).
