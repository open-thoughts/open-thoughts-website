## Open Thoughts
*Curating the best open reasoning datasets. Work in progress.*

Our first **goal** is to curate a reasoning dataset to train a model that outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Distill [32B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B) and [7B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B).

### News
*Jan 28, 2025*: We launched the Open Thoughts project and [OpenThoughts-114k dataset](https://huggingface.co/mlfoundations-dev)

*Jan 22, 2025*: We [released](https://www.bespokelabs.ai/blog/bespoke-stratos-the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-reasoning-distillation) our [Bespoke-Stratos-17k dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bespokelabs/Bespoke-Stratos-17k), [Bespoke-Stratos-7B model](https://huggingface.co/bespokelabs/Bespoke-Stratos-7B) , [Bespoke-Stratos-32B model](https://huggingface.co/bespokelabs/Bespoke-Stratos-32B) 

### About us

We are a team of researchers and engineers from Bespoke Labs, Stanford, University of California Berkeley, University of Washington, Juelich Supercomputing Center (JSC), LAION, UCLA, UNC Chapel Hill, and Toyota Research Institute united around building the best datasets (and thus the best models). See our previous works at [datacomp.ai](https://www.datacomp.ai/) and [mlfoundations](https://github.com/mlfoundations).
