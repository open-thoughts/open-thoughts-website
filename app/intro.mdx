## Open Thoughts
Curating the best open reasoning datasets.  A [bespokelabs](https://bespokelabs.ai/) and [datacomp](https://www.datacomp.ai/) community effort.

Our first goal is to curate a reasoning dataset to train state of the art small reasoning models that surpass [DeepSeek-R1-Distill-32B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B) and [DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) on math and code reasoning benchmarks.

{/* ### News */}
{/* *Jan 28, 2025*: We launched the Open Thoughts project and [OpenThoughts-114k dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-thoughts/OpenThoughts-114k) */}

{/* *Jan 22, 2025*: We [released](https://www.bespokelabs.ai/blog/bespoke-stratos-the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-reasoning-distillation) our [Bespoke-Stratos-17k dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bespokelabs/Bespoke-Stratos-17k), [Bespoke-Stratos-7B model](https://huggingface.co/bespokelabs/Bespoke-Stratos-7B) , [Bespoke-Stratos-32B model](https://huggingface.co/bespokelabs/Bespoke-Stratos-32B) */}

### About us

We are a team of researchers and engineers from Bespoke Labs, Stanford, University of California Berkeley, University of Washington, Juelich Supercomputing Center (JSC), LAION, UCLA, UNC Chapel Hill, and Toyota Research Institute united around building the best datasets (and thus the best models). See our previous works at [datacomp.ai](https://www.datacomp.ai/) and [mlfoundations](https://github.com/mlfoundations).

Open Thoughts is supported by [Bespoke Labs](https://www.bespokelabs.ai/), [Lambda Labs](https://lambdalabs.com/), [NSF IFML](https://www.ifml.institute/), [Juelich Supercomputing Center](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc), [Toyota Research Institute](https://www.tri.global/).
